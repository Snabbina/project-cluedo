# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer
This weekâ€™s project is to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo, and practice creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM.

## The problem

Invoking the right functions to pick (generate) a murderer, a room or a weapon. Storing info in objects and arrays. Visually see the chosen cards in the browser, and resetting the cards solving it all with JavaScript, Html and Css.

Followed every step of the exercise, making sure every step worked before I went to the next one, console log and showning in the browser. If I had more time, I would like to work on the Css design and adding more futures to the interactivity.
